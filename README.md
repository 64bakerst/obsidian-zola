# Zola-PKM

This repo is a Zola theme made for converting simple Markdown personal knowledge management (PKM) systems into a Zola website. It has only been tested on Obsidian.

# Features
This repo is forked from the [Adidoks](https://github.com/aaranxu/adidoks) theme. However, several changes are made to alter / improve the use experience.

## Enhancements
**Search Function**
Partial strings are supported now. Since PKM often invole plenty of jargons and the default elasticlunr (of course) cannot do proper stemming on those words, partial string search is an absolute must when it comes to PKM searching.

**Fonts**
Changed default font to Inter for a neater interface.

Changed monospace font to Fira Code because who doesn't love font ligatures?

**KaTEX**
Updated KaTEX to latest version and loads KaTEX by default. Since who on earth builds a PKM without any LaTEX :)

**Table of Content**
Again, who wants to write a PKM page without proper TOC navigation :))

## Small Chanages
**Change Default Content**
Default footers, licenses and menu items are gone. Bye and see you never!

**Example Site Materials**
Deleted example site content and stuff to prevent a bloated repo :)
